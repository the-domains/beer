description: "When it's frigid and snowy, forage in your pantry for food with staying power and a reminder of garden flair. Kimchee & IPA This sharply spicy cabbage- and radish-based dish supercharges an IPA that leans piney/garlicky/oniony; juicy, tropical hops will certainly clash. The beer's bitterness bristles the tongue and tones down the spice."
